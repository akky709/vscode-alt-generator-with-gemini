This must be useful for users with visual impairments or those whose images fail to load.\n    * *Example: Instead of \"Puppy,\" write specifically \"Dalmatian puppy playing fetch.\"*\n2. **Contextual Relevance:** Refer to the surrounding text content and naturally incorporate **key keywords** relevant to the page's main topic and content context.\n3.  **Keyword Stuffing Prohibition:** You must **absolutely avoid** unnaturally listing keywords for SEO purposes (keyword stuffing).\n4.  **Strict Output Format:** Output **only the generated alt text** (the content to be placed within HTML's `alt=\"\"`). Do not include any other explanations, quotes, or preceding phrases (e.g., \"alt text:\").",
